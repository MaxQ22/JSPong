# JSPong
 JSPong is a simple Pong clone browser game, written in HTML5/Javascript. The goal of this project was to dip my toes into Javascript programming and realize my first web application. The code does not use any object orientation (although it probably should have), which shows my ANSI-C background.

## Playing
 The game enables two players to play Pong against each other. Furthermore, one (or even both) of the players can be controlled by the game. Whichever player scores 5 points first, wins the game. A player scores a point, if the opposing player is unable to catch the ball with their paddle, before it leaves the game aerea. The direction, the ball bounces of the paddle is determined by the position on the paddle the ball hits.

## Player Control
 The left player`s paddle is controlled by the W and S keys, while the right player`s paddle is controlled by the arrow up and arrow down keys.

 ## Options
 Before the game start, the Players Names can be selected, showing them trhoughout the game. Furthermore, a selection has to be made, which player is controlled via a keyboard and which player is controlled by the game computer.  It is even possible to habe both players controlled by the computer and just watch the game!
